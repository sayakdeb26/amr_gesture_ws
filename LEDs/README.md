# ZED Object Detection with Python

This repository demonstrates how to perform object detection using the ZED SDK in Python. The project uses the ZED Python API to capture images from a ZED camera, run object detection with tracking, and display the results using OpenCV.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that you have met the following requirements:

- **ZED SDK**: Download and install the [ZED SDK](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/).  
  - **Windows:** The Python install script is located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\ZED SDK\`. Make sure you run it with admin privileges, or copy it to another location if needed.
  - **Linux:** The install script can be executed automatically during the SDK installation. When prompted, press `Y` to install the Python API.

- **Python 3.6+ (x64)**: A 64-bit version of Python is required.

- **Dependencies**: The following Python packages are needed:
  - Cython (0.26+)
  - Numpy (1.13+)
  - OpenCV Python (optional, but required for image display)
  - PyOpenGL (optional)

## Installation

### Python Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip.

**Linux:**

```bash
python -m pip install cython numpy opencv-python pyopengl
